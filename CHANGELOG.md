# Changelog

## 3.10.0

- Add explicit registered attached/detached deformation regions with active-region selection and safe legacy `head` migration.
- Add connected face-patch, selected-vertex, single-face, and cursor capture with stale-capture detection.
- Add world-edge geodesic distance with radius-limited Dijkstra traversal and topology-aware caching.
- Add patch-only, patch-feathered, and connected-surface influence masks.
- Add editable, ordered trauma-stamp recipes with stable IDs and deterministic Basis rebuilds.
- Add Compact Dent, Broad Cave, Flat Compression, Directional Shear, Raised Impact Rim, and Ridge Collapse families.
- Preserve exact-index world-space attached/detached synchronization, legacy standard head keys, preview controls, sculpt/sync, mirror, GLB morph export, and schema `dreadstone.damage_deformation.v1`.
- Extend deformation manifests additively with registered regions and compact ordered stamp metadata.
- Add standard-library trauma-field algorithm tests and expanded static contracts.

## 3.9.1

- Evaluate seed radius and depth in world space.
- Synchronize attached/detached deltas with world-transform awareness.
- Validate deformation deltas and maximum displacement in world space.
- Add attached, detached, and both/overlay preview controls.
- Initialize standard deformation keys at zero.
- Automatically solo the active deformation key and seed preview.
- Add **BUILD ACTIVE PRESET**.
- Add a localized dent preset with a subtle raised rim.
- Strengthen preset and slider ranges for readable world-scale results.
- Keep sculpting optional.
